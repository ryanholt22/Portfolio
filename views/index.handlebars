            <p>This first app is called BandAid. Created to find new music that you enjoy, simliar to Apple Music, Soundcloud, and Spotify.</p>
            <p>We created this app because we all enjoyed music but most of these other apps are sometimes to complicated and you can find youself in a deep hole </p>
